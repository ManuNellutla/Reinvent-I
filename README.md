# Reinvent-I
This repository is my notes, my lab exercises, my research and my sandbox in DATASCIENCE field.

# I intened to organize this my topics in data science like 
1. Statistics
2. Modeling, 
3. Machine learning, 
4. Visualization


Each topic may have multiple formats like python / jupyter notebooks, R or RMD files.

I will mostly create JypiterNotebooks and RMD files for a better organization.
